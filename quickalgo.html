                <p>
                    Time taken by QuickSort, in general, can be written as follows.
                    
                    T(n) = T(k) + T(n-k-1) + \theta (n)
                    
                    The first two terms are for two recursive calls, the last term is for the partition process. k is the number of elements
                    that are smaller than the pivot.
                    The time taken by QuickSort depends upon the input array and partition strategy. Following are three cases.
            
                    <br>
                <p><b>Q. Best Case:?</b></p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The best case occurs when the partition process always picks the middle element as the pivot. The following is
                    recurrence for the best case.
                    
                    T(n) = 2T(n/2) + \theta (n)
                </p>
                <p><b>Worst Case:?</b></p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The worst case occurs when the partition process always picks the greatest or smallest element as the pivot. If we
                    consider the above partition strategy where the last element is always picked as a pivot, the worst case would occur
                    when the array is already sorted in increasing or decreasing order. Following is recurrence for the worst case.
                    
                    T(n) = T(0) + T(n-1) + \theta (n)which is equivalent to T(n) = T(n-1) + \theta (n)
                </p>
                <br>
                <p><b>Avarage Case:?</b></p>
                <p>
                    To do average case analysis, we need to consider all possible permutation of array and calculate time taken by every
                    permutation which doesnâ€™t look easy.
                    We can get an idea of average case by considering the case when partition puts O(n/9) elements in one set and O(9n/10)
                    elements in other set. Following is recurrence for this case.
                    
                    T(n) = T(n/9) + T(9n/10) + \theta (n)
