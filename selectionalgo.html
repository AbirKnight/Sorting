                    Time Complexity: The time complexity of Selection Sort is O(N2) as there are two nested loops:
                    
                    One loop to select an element of Array one by one = O(N)
                    Another loop to compare that element with every other Array element = O(N)
                    Therefore overall complexity = O(N) * O(N) = O(N*N) = O(N2)
                    
                    Auxiliary Space: O(1) as the only extra memory used is for temporary variables while swapping two values in Array. The
                    selection sort never makes more than O(N) swaps and can be useful when memory write is a costly operation.

                    <p><b>Q. Is Selection Sort Algorithm stable?</b></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Stability: The default implementation is not stable. However, it can be made stable. Please see stable selection sort
                    for details.</p>

                    <br>
                    <p>Yes, it does not require extra space.
