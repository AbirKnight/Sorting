                    Time Complexity: O(N log(N)), Sorting arrays on different machines. Merge Sort is a recursive algorithm and time
                    complexity can be expressed as following recurrence relation.
                    
                    T(n) = 2T(n/2) + θ(n)
                    
                    The above recurrence can be solved either using the Recurrence Tree method or the Master method. It falls in case II of
                    the Master Method and the solution of the recurrence is θ(Nlog(N)). The time complexity of Merge Sort isθ(Nlog(N)) in
                    all 3 cases (worst, average, and best) as merge sort always divides the array into two halves and takes linear time to
                    merge two halves.
                    
                    Auxiliary Space: O(n), In merge sort all elements are copied into an auxiliary array. So N auxiliary space is required
                    for merge sort.

                <p><b>Q. How can we make Merge sort more efficient?</b></p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Merge sort can be made more efficient by replacing recursive calls with Insertion sort for smaller array sizes, where
                    the size of the remaining array is less or equal to 43 as the number of operations required to sort an array of max size
                    43 will be less in Insertion sort as compared to the number of operations required in Merge sort.

                <br>
                <p>
                    A merge sort consists of several passes over the input. The first pass merges segments of size 1, the second merges
                    segments of size 2, and the i_{th} pass merges segments of size 2i-1. Thus, the total number of passes is [log2n]. As
                    merge showed, we can merge two sorted segments in linear time, which means that each pass takes O(n) time. Since there
                    are [log2n] passes, the total computing time is O(nlogn).
